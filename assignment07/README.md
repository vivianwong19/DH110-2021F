# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype
Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110: User Experience & Design

## Introduction
The purpose of my project, which is called the HI, Hawaii! app, is to provide residents and visitors of Hawaii with a comprehensive guide of the different state parks Hawaii has to offer, as well as the different activities that are available to do there. The purpose of this phase is to create an interactive prototype that mimics how the app would work if it were to be fully designed and developed. Using the prototype, I am able to conduct cognitive walkthrough interviews in order to understand how people would naturally interact with the app when asked to do certain tasks. I am able to observe if there are any points of confusion or frustration and make further adjustments as necessary before delivering a final product.

## The Tasks and The Prototype

I designed and prototyped two tasks that the high fidelity prototype supports.

### Task 1: State Parks Filtering Feature
* The prototype allows the user to interact with the filtering feature, which allows the user to filter by zip code, island, or activities. This is where the user can find comprehensive guides on the state parks and the activities that they can do there.

### Task 2: Writing a Review
* The prototype allows the user to interact with the review feature, which includes reading other user's reviews, reading the past reviews the user wrote, writing and publishing a new review, and editing and deleting past reviews.

### Task 1: State Parks Filtering Feature
* I wanted the user to use the filtering feature and see how they would interact with the different elements on the page. I also wanted to see if they knew where to obtain more information regarding the state park within this page as well.

### Task 2: Writing a Review
* I wanted the user to write a review for a state park. I also wanted to see if they would know how to edit the review when requested.
