# HI, Hawaii! - a state parks finder for residents and visitors of Hawaii

Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110

Assignment 08: Pitch

### Introduction:

This project was inspired by the beautiful state parks and beaches that Hawaii is known for. I took large inspiration from Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources website (which I conducted a heuristic evaluation and competitor analysis for). After seeing the website, I wanted to create a state parks finder that would consolidate all of the information regarding Hawaii's state parks, guides, and recreational activities since users have to search through multiple sites in order to find all of the information needed for their trips. The project's purpose is to serve as a platform for residents and visitors of Hawaii to find and explore the beautiful scenery and activities that the islands have to offer.


### Clear design statement: 
Currently, people rely on a variety of websites in order to find information when planning their trips. Additionally, when I was conducting usability testing on Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources website, there were various points of confusion my participant had when interacting with the site, which I wanted to address in my project. I wanted to consolidate as much information and features within my project so that it could be the ultimate resource for planning trips to Hawaii's state parks.

### Competitor analysis:
I had initially intended for my project to focus on tourism, so for my competitor analysis, I decided to look at two websites. One website was by Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources -- Division of State Parks, which focuses on providing users with information regarding recreational activities and state parks. The second website was by Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, which provides users with information regarding locally owned businesses and marketplaces in Hawaii. 

I conducted heuristic evaluations for both of these websites because they are both related to tourism, but I eventually shifted the focus of my project towards Hawaii's state parks and creating improvements upon what the Department of Land and Natural Resources already has. I wanted to redesign this website and create a project that was more interactive and personalized for users for when they plan their trips. The landing page of the Department of Land and Natural Resources website can be found below.
