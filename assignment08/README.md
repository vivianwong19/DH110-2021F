# HI, Hawaii! - a state parks finder for residents and visitors of Hawaii

Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110

Assignment 08: Pitch

### Introduction:

This project was inspired by the beautiful state parks and beaches that Hawaii is known for. I took large inspiration from Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources website (which I conducted a heuristic evaluation and competitor analysis for). After seeing the website, I wanted to create a state parks finder that would consolidate all of the information regarding Hawaii's state parks, guides, and recreational activities. The project's purpose is to serve as a platform for residents and visitors of Hawaii to find and explore the beautiful outdoors that the islands have to offer.
