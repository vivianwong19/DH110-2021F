### Purpose of UX Storytelling
> The purpose of UX storytelling is to empathize with the user and to see things from their perspective as the designer. Through usability testing and contextual inquiry interviews, we are able to get a glimpse of other people's personal experiences with the topic we are designing for. Using this qualitative data, we can create personas that represent our user, as well as scenarios they may face, as part of the UX storytelling process. This process allows  the designer to create a product that suits the needs of various users across demographics.
