# Usability Testing
## Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing of Hawaii's Government Website
Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

### Introduction
[Hawaii's Division of State Parks website](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/) provides information for residents and tourists regarding local recreational activities they are able to engage in around the area. This includes maps and guides of Hawaii's state parks, information about camping reservations, hiking trails, and local wildlife. However, as I was conducting heuristic evaluations for this website, I noticed a few usability issues that I wanted to test. 

The purpose of usability testing is for designers to get an outside perspective and better empathize with the intended user. By testing the design through usability testing, we are able to see if the user experience and user interface is easy for people to interact and navigate through. There are three main metrics of usability when it comes to UX / UI : **effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.** 
By asking participants of usability testing to perform tasks on a website, we are able to collect empirical data and observations on how they interact with the website and design. Through their performance on these tasks, we are able to learn more about the usefulness of a design, pinpoint areas of frustration, and improve performance early on.

From my heuristic evaluation, I had noticed a few issues that I wanted to test. The first task was intended to lead the participant towards the "List" view of the "Parks" page, which provides information about the activities that can be done around the area -- such as hiking, camping/lodging, beaches, and historical sightseeing. The current design displays a large map with location markers of the state parks, but nothing about the activities. There is a "List" tab, but it was fairly hidden which gave me trouble finding it when I was conducting my heuristic evaluation. The second task was to get the participant to interact with the "Camping & Lodging" page, as well as the specific state park page to gather information regarding the park. I wanted to see if the current organization of the website was easy to navigate through. Finally, for the third task, I wanted to see how people would interact with the "Wildlife" page, since it was a smaller section of the website that was packed with information and text compared to the first two tasks. For this, I wanted to see how users would process this information in relation to the visual content (pictures) on the site.

The usability test I conducted was a pilot test with my friend. The setting was in her apartment. I used my laptop as the device to conduct the test and record the session. I used Google Forms to create the survey that contained the usability testing questions. I used Zoom to capture the screen recording of the website as well as our faces to observe the reactions to the website. 

The process of the test was as followed:
* Introduction
* Informed Consent Form
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* Task 1 - Finding a specific state park based off given information
* Task 2 - Finding information about a camping site and nearby activities
* Task 3 - Finding information about Hawaii's local wildlife
* Post-Test Questions
* System Usability Scale
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

## Reflection
Overall, I thought the usability testing session went pretty well. There were definitely still a couple areas where things didn't go as smoothly. For example, there were moments when I was unsure of if I could jump in as a moderator, and I wasn't certain on what I was allowed to say as the moderator as well -- especially when the participant got lost or was asking specific questions. I also discovered that Task 1, which I believed to be my hardest task, was an important issue that needed to be addressed. It took my participant a while to find the "List" part of the "Parks" page, and it was very difficult to
