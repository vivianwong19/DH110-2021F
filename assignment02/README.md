# Usability Testing
## Assignment 02: Pilot Usability Testing of Hawaii's Government Website
Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

### Introduction
Hawaii's Division of State Parks website provides information for residents and tourists regarding local recreational activities they are able to engage in around the area. This includes maps and guides of Hawaii's state parks, information about camping reservations, hiking trails, and local wildlife. However, as I was conducting heuristic evaluations for this website, I noticed a few usability issues that I wanted to test. 

The purpose of usability testing is for designers to get an outside perspective and better empathize with the intended user. By testing the design through usability testing, we are able to see if the user experience and user interface is easy for people to interact and navigate through. There are three main metrics of usability when it comes to UX / UI : **effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.** 
By asking participants of usability testing to perform tasks on a website, we are able to collect empirical data and observations on how they interact with the website and design. Through their performance on these tasks, we are able to learn more about the usefulness of a design, pinpoint areas of frustration, and improve performance early on.

REASONING BEHIND THE TASKS

The usability test I conducted was a pilot test with my friend. The setting was in her apartment. I used my laptop as the device to conduct the test and record the session. I used Zoom to capture the screen recording of the website as well as our faces to observe the reactions to the website. 

The process of the test was as followed:
* Introduction
* Informed Consent Form
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* Task 1 - Finding a specific state park based off given information
* Task 2 - Finding information about a camping site and nearby activities
* Task 3 - Finding information about Hawaii's local wildlife
* Post-Test Questions
* System Usability Scale
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics
