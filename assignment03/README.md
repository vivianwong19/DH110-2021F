# Contextual Inquiry

## Assignment 03: Qualitative User Research via Contextual Inquiry
Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Step 1: Specify the Research Goal & Requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
* My project would help residents and visitors of Hawaii plan trips to state parks by providing a comprehensive guide regarding the activities and general information about the parks.

#### What is the basic need or goal involved for that activity?
* This activity would fulfill the user's aesthetic needs since the goal of this project is to help users better explore nature. According to [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), for humans to better understand the beauty of the world, they should be immersing themselves in what nature has to offer.

#### What are the traditional / current solutions that satisfy these needs?
* Current solutions that satisfies these needs include government websites, travel / nature blogs, travel planning websites like TripAdvisor, and social medias. Books (such as travel guides) and videos are also a resource that users can consult. When it comes to planning a trip, there is a lot of information for users to browse through, which may be quite overwhelming.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
* Certain limitations with the current solution is that there is a huge variety of resources to search from - all of which have different reputations and features. With the use of digital technology, we can create a more consolidated information guide for users searching for this information. It may be the most beneficial to add features and information on top of the pre-existing government websites, since that is one of the most reliable resources when it comes to state parks. 
* Digital technology can also make it easier for people to access information on their devices, especially if it's accessible without data. It also makes it organize plans through itineraries and share it with other people as well.

## Step 2: Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: Teenagers and adults, people who enjoy travelling and sightseeing - includes both residents and visitors of Hawaii, people who enjoy exploring nature, and people who enjoy physical activities like hiking, swimming, and camping.
* Preferences: These users are people who enjoy engaging in outdoor activities as a hobby, and are willing to visit a state park to participate in these activities.
* Expertise: The users would not require any level of expertise to use this project.

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity?
