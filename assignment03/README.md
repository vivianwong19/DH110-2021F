# Contextual Inquiry

## Assignment 03: Qualitative User Research via Contextual Inquiry
Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design

## Step 1: Specify the Research Goal & Requirements

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
* My project would help residents and visitors of Hawaii plan trips to state parks by providing a comprehensive guide regarding the activities and general information about the parks.

#### What is the basic need or goal involved for that activity?
* This activity would fulfill the user's aesthetic needs since the goal of this project is to help users better explore nature. According to [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), for humans to better understand the beauty of the world, they should be immersing themselves in what nature has to offer.

#### What are the traditional / current solutions that satisfy these needs?
* To satisfy a user's aesthetic needs, current solutions include participating in outdoor activities (such as hiking, camping, sightseeing) in order to further expose them to the beauty of nature.
* Current solutions that satisfies these needs in relation to my project include government websites, travel / nature blogs, travel planning websites like TripAdvisor, and social medias. Books (such as travel guides), videos, and word-of-mouth recommendations are also a resource that users can consult. When it comes to planning a trip, there is a lot of information for users to browse through, which may be quite overwhelming.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
* Certain limitations with the current solution is that there is a huge variety of resources to search from - all of which have different reputations and features. With the use of digital technology, we can create a more consolidated information guide for users searching for this information. It may be the most beneficial to add features and information on top of the pre-existing government websites, since that is one of the most reliable resources when it comes to state parks. 
* Digital technology can also make it easier for people to access information on their devices, especially if it's accessible without data. It also makes it organize plans through itineraries and share it with other people as well.

## Step 2: Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users?
* Demographics: Teenagers and adults, people who enjoy travelling and sightseeing - includes both residents and visitors of Hawaii, people who enjoy exploring nature, and people who enjoy physical activities like hiking, swimming, and camping.
* Preferences: These users would be people who enjoy engaging in outdoor activities as a hobby, and are willing to visit a state park to participate in these activities.
* Expertise: The users would not require any level of expertise to use this project.

#### In which context (where, why) would the users do that activity? 
* The user would research information about Hawaii's state parks and activities in the context that they are planning a trip to the state park, or if they have general interest in learning more information when it comes to state parks and nature. 

#### What do the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
* To search for information regarding a new location, residents and visitors would probably look online for resources related to the area and nearby activities. They might also research the area by reading books or watching videos about the location. They may also receive recommendations from friends and family about locations to visit and things to do.

## Step 3: Picking the Qualitative Research Methods

#### Methods
* The research methods I used for this project includes a combination of **interviewing** and **participatory observation**.
  * The interview was conducted virtually over Zoom, since my interviewee does not currently live in Westwood. I used my Macbook to set up the Zoom meeting and record the video and audio of our conversation, as well as the screen recording of the user activities. This part of the interview required my interviewee to research and identify a state park in Hawaii that they would be interested in visiting. 
  * For the participatory observation activity, I asked my interviewee to create an itinerary for for the state park they identified. I shared a Google document with the interviewee so that they could type out their itinerary while keeping the screen shared. The purpose of the participatory observation activity was to see how the user would research and identify activities that they want to do at a particular location. I also wanted to see what else was important when it comes to planning a trip outside of the activities.

#### Interesting insights from the interview:
1. Recommendations and first-person accounts are important when it comes to finding a new location
  > "I try to look for first person accounts of people’s personal experiences and what they like best. I might go on a government website to see what trails are available, but in terms of deciding which one I’d go to first, like which trail I’d go to first, I’d look for, like, someone’s experience like on Reddit or like a blog someone has who looks like they do it a lot." (4:51)
2. Convenience is a major factor when it comes to planning activities
  > "[The itinerary is] basically like a skeleton of what I want the day to look like. Basically I’m trying to organize and then make sure I’m not driving excessively. So I, like, drive up to the park and do everything there, and then drive back. Instead of driving back and forth… just for convenience’s sake." (32:00) 
3. Activity preferences can change based on location
  > "I think it depends on each place I go to. Like if I was going to Hawaii, then I’d want to see, like, public nature areas." (35:56)


  > "If I was in a metro area, then I’d want to do activities like eating, or experiencing their nightlife." (36:28)
4. Extensive research and planning are preferred over spontaneous trips
  > "I think I’d rather research and make sure I’m not missing anything that’s really fun to do there. Because if I want to go - if I were to go to a new place, I’d want to make the most out of it instead of just spontaneously being like “oh, here it is, I don’t know what there is to do here”. Unless someone else planned the trip, then I’ll be like “okay, whatever. I’ll do what you planned cause you researched it”. Or I think someone should have researched it." (38:01)
