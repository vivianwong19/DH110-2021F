# Assignment 06: Interface Design
Vivian Wong, Digital Humanities 110: User Experience & Design

## Introduction
The purpose of my project is to provide residents and visitors of Hawaii with a comprehensive guide to all the state parks that Hawaii has to offer. The app, called HI, Hawaii!, will include maps, guides, reviews, and a personal trip tracker for Hawaii's state parks. 

The purpose of this interface design is to convert the low-fidelity designs into a digitized design with a developed style (i.e. color palette, shape variation, typographic variation). The process of digitizing my low-fidelity design was done through Figma. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 11 Pro / X screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, Hawaii's Division of State Parks website, and Material Design. Creating this graphic design system and making it reusable within Figma will make the process of creating additional frames easier and quicker in the future.

I created the list view of the park finder feature in Figma for my example wireframe. This is what it currently looks like:

Here is the link to my [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/1j8qRtvSNIq4P38Ih8IAZZ/DH-110-Assignment-06?node-id=0%3A1), which shows the full screen design:

### Summary of Findings
With the 5-second first impressions test, the interviewee remembered the colors they noticed, the general content of the text, and a filter option (referencing the drop-down feature). 

When I asked for their opinion on the design, these are some of the key takeaways from the interview:
> Referencing the decorative header text: "I don't really understand why it is in that font compared to the rest of the app."

> Referencing the toggle button between the map and list views: "I feel like there might be a better way to indicate the toggle between the back and the forth of that." 

> Referencing the activities icons: "Right now, I would have to make assumptions on what those icons are."

> Referencing the color palette: "I like the white and the blue, it kind of reminds me of the ocean and sand. And the green with the palm trees. I'm just not a big fan of the brown."


In summary, the interviewee noted how the color scheme matched the inspiration that I used (the images from Hawaii's Division of State Parks website). However, they did not like the brown color that was used in the branding of the website. They also noted how there could be ways to make the app more convenient, such as with the activities icons and ways to improve the toggle button. I was able to use this feedback to create a new toggle button before writing up this documentation, which is why the toggle button design looks different between this documentation and the impressions video.
